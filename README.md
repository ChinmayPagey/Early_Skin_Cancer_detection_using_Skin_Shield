Skin Shield by: AI-Powered Skin Cancer Detection
Skin Shield by Chinmay (20MIA1112) is an AI-based application designed to help users 
identify potential skin cancer by analyzing skin lesion images. 
Leveraging a deep learning model, Skin Shield classifies lesions as 
benign or malignant, making early detection more accessible, especially 
for underserved communities. This project aims to assist dermatologists 
and patients alike by providing a fast, accurate preliminary analysis 
that can guide further diagnosis.

Introduction
Skincancer is a prevalent form of cancer worldwide, and early diagnosis can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Skin Shield by Chinmay aims  to make preliminary screening available at one's fingertips by using a deep learning model to analyze smartphone images of skin lesions. 
With Skin Shield by Chinmay, patients can:
Upload photos of skin lesions for analysis.
Receive an instant classification of the lesion as benign or malignant.
Connect with dermatologists if further consultation is needed.
Features
Image Upload: Users can upload images of skin lesions via the web interface.
AI Model for Classification: The model classifies lesions into benign or malignant categories.
Data Privacy: Images are securely processed, with an option to delete them after analysis.
Report Generation: The application provides a downloadable report for user records.
Integration with Dermatologists: A system to connect patients with dermatologists if required.
Dataset
The
 model was trained on a large dataset of skin lesion images. The dataset
 is highly imbalanced, with a majority of benign images and a small 
percentage of malignant cases. Key attributes include:
age_approx: Approximate age of the patient.
sex: Gender of the patient.
anatom_site_general: Anatomical location of the lesion.
clin_size_long_diam_mm: Clinical size of the lesion.
image_type and tbp_tile_type: Metadata about image acquisition.
Note: All images were resized to 133x133 pixels to fit model requirements.
Model Architecture
The model was built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for binary classification. Key components include:
Input Layer: 133x133 pixel images.
Convolutional Layers: For feature extraction from images.
Pooling Layers: To reduce dimensionality.
Dense Layers: For final classification.
Activation Function: Softmax for binary classification.

Limitations and Future Work
While Skin Shield by Chinmay is a promising tool for early detection, there are limitations:
Imbalanced Dataset: The model may be biased due to the dataset's imbalance.
Image Quality: Accuracy may vary with low-resolution images from smartphones.
False Positives/Negatives: Some benign cases may be flagged as malignant and vice versa.
Future Work
Model Improvement: Experiment with advanced architectures to improve accuracy.
Deployment: Extend the deployment to cloud servers for scalability.
Mobile App Integration: Develop an Android/iOS app for easier access.
